=head1 NAME

Text::CSV::Easy_XS - Easy (and fast) CSV parsing and building

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.50

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Text::CSV::Easy_XS qw(csv_build csv_parse);

  my @fields = csv_parse($string);
  my $string = csv_build(@fields);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Text::CSV::Easy_XS is a simple module for parsing and building simple CSV fields.

This module conforms to RFC 4180 for both parsing and building of CSV strings.

=over 4

=item 1. Use commas to separate fields. Spaces will be considered part of the field.

 abc,def, ghi        => ( 'abc', 'def', 'ghi ' )

=item 2. You may enclose fields in quotes.

 "abc","def"         => ( 'abc', 'def' )

=item 3. If your field contains a line break, a comma, or a quote, you need to enclose it in quotes. A quote should be escaped with another quote.

 "a,b","a\nb","a""b" => ( 'a,b', "a\nb", 'a"b' )

=item 4. A trailing newline is acceptable.

 abc,def\n           => ( 'abc', 'def' )

=back

When building a string using csv_build, all non-numeric strings will always be enclosed in quotes.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 csv_build( List @fields ) : Str

Takes a list of fields and will generate a csv string. This subroutine will raise an exception if any errors occur.

=head2 csv_parse( Str $string ) : List[Str]

Parses a CSV string. Returns a list of fields it found. This subroutine will raise an exception if a string could not be properly parsed.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

Note: this module is still in an *alpha* state. This has not been tested with threads. Use at your own risk.
